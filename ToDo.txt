# FlyShock Next Features To Add
    Crossing Line Position Tool (GUI-based)

        User drags a horizontal line on frame to set position before processing
 
        Ensure this is intuitive and visible

     Real-Time Counts Display

        Display fly counts top/bottom zones on live processed video

        Optional: Include these in CSV comments too

    Save Per-Crossing Timestamp

        Each time a fly crosses, log exact timestamp (relative to video or absolute)

    Option to Save Raw Crossing Times Separately

        New optional CSV or embedded section in the same file

    Cross Detection Improvements

        Consider optical flow or contour tracking if needed (low priority for now)
